# MartialPerformance
Description is copied from original Nexus Page. I just decompiled it and recompiled it with updated binaries.

 This mod adds Martial Performance as a Bard or Skald talent.

Do you like me wish you could play a more martial oriented Bard or Skald for your Azata playthrough? Do you crave that sweet, sweet Mythic Weapon Specialization without losing precious Bard progression by going into Eldritch Knight? Well, fear not, this mod is for you!

This mod adds the Martial Performance feature from Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Beast. It is selectable at level 6 as a Bard or Skald talent, since Versatile Performance is not a thing in this game.

Known issues:
It doesn't give you weapon proficiency if you don't already have it, instead it requires proficiency and always gives Weapon Focus. It is implemented as the same feature for both classes, so if you multiclass Bard with Skald, expect some non RAW behaviour. But who in their right mind would do that?

Compatibility issues:
Any mod that adds more weapon types will not work with this.
